RIT: ISTE 454 Mobile Application Development IOS Final Project 

StayEasy is a mobile application designed to help users find and book short-term lodging and unique accommodations directly from property owners. This app is for travelers seeking affordable lodging options and property owners who want to rent out their space. 
It stands out due to its added focus on community-based features, allowing guests to interact with locals, offering recommendations for things to do, and highlighting neighborhood insights.
